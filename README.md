# Auth Translation API sample

A sample Zuplo API that enables self-serve API Key management in your product's dashboard. This sample can be used in conjunction with the Zuplo [API Key Manager react](https://github.com/zuplo/api-key-manager) component.

This project uses Zuplo's [API Key Management service](https://zuplo.com/docs/articles/api-key-management) to security store your API Keys.

For a full tutorial on how to use this sample with the react component see [Zuplo's blog post]([https://zuplo.com/blog](https://zuplo.com/blog/2023/08/08/open-source-release)).
